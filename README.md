_**A Discord bot built for gaming.**_

**HirstBot** is my current chatbot project for Discord. It currently features commands that can:

* Show permissions of a user
* Display Pokedex entries

As I expand the bot's functionality, I hope to add:

* League of Legends / champion.gg API
* Wikipedia (WikiMedia) API
* Advanced "BattleDex" and Smogon pokemon retrievals
* Game database
* ... and more!

# License

This bot is published under the **MIT License** as of February 2017.

*Hrist is named after the youngest of the three Valkyries with a predisposition for deception and darkness.*
