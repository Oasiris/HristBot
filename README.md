# HirstBot - Discord Gaming Bot

[<img src=https://img.shields.io/badge/discord.js-v11.x-yellow.svg>](http://discordjs.readthedocs.io/en/8.2.0/) [<img src=https://img.shields.io/badge/node-v6.x-brightgreen.svg>](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/) <img src=https://img.shields.io/npm/l/express.svg>

_**A Discord bot built for gaming.**_

**HirstBot** is my current chatbot project for Discord. It currently features basic commands that can:

* Talk to Cleverbot
* Display Pokedex entries
* Text analytics (get word count, character count, etc.)

As I expand the bot's functionality, I hope to add:

* League of Legends / champion.gg API
* Wikipedia (WikiMedia) API
* Fire Emblem Heroes database
* Advanced "BattleDex" and Smogon pokemon retrievals
* Game database
* ... and more!

## Version

The bleeding-edge version is `0.0.3.`
The latest official version is `0.0.2.`

You can find the changelog [here](https://github.com/Oasiris/HristBot/wiki/Changelog).

## Add the bot to your server

Currently, I am hosting HirstBot locally rather than on a server. This link will be more useful once I reliably host HirstBot on a database:

https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=266497960160919552&scope=bot&permissions=0

## Installation

1. Make sure that you have installed Node.js v6.0.0 or higher and a recent version of npm (I'm using 3.10.10).
2. Clone or download this repository to your system. Save it in a directory you can remember!
3. In a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the terminal and type "node bot.js" or "npm start" to launch the bot.

Enjoy!
